            <p class="center-align deep-purple-text yellow">About the project</p>
            <p>Q: What is To Be You about?</p>
            <p>To Be You is an experiential and interactive mobile game that seeks to cultivate empathy debuts on 21 July 2021, Singapore’s Racial Harmony Day. The immersive fiction game gets to the heart of empathy by letting players experience "life" as someone else, make life choices, discover challenges and dilemmas, and connect with the life journeys of people from different backgrounds.</p>
            <p>First conceptualised by a team from Better.sg in 2020, To Be You won the top prize at the 2020 MCCY ‘A Mission:Unite Hackathon’, a hackathon spurring youths to identify challenges and ideate ways to bring about greater social compact. Conceived to help dismantle stereotypes, reduce prejudice, and ultimately foster greater empathy and inclusiveness among Singaporeans, To Be You offers a fun game experience that will deliberate issues pertinent to the society today. To achieve authentic representations of what Singaporeans go through emotionally in the face of discrimination, To Be You worked with community organisations, focus groups, researchers, and writers to create compelling fictional stories based upon real stories from Singaporeans.</p>
            <p>“In a multicultural society, empathy is not optional. Our diversity is what makes us unique and we really want this game to be something that sparks change in the communities. Our team believes that empathy cannot be taught through lessons or excursions- it must be experienced and felt. We want Singaporeans to learn about the challenges of people different from themselves, to interact with their peers, to take the time to listen to their stories and experiences, and to understand what it’s like to be somebody else,” said Gaurav Keerthi, CEO of Better.sg and Co-Lead of To Be You.</p>
