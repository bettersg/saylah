      <p class="c1"><span class="team-text ">Your privacy is important to us. It is our policy to respect your privacy and
          comply with any applicable law and regulations in Singapore regarding any personal information we may collect about you,
          including across our website, and other sites we operate. This policy is effective as of 1 June 2021 and was
          last updated on 21 July 2021. </span></p>
      <p class="c1"><span class="p-body-20">Information We Collect</span></p>
      <p class="c1"><span class="team-text ">Information we collect includes both information you knowingly and actively provide
          us when using or participating in any of our services, and any information automatically sent
          by your devices in the course of accessing our product.</span></p>
      <span class="p-body-20">Log Data</span></p>
      <p class="c1"><span class="team-text ">When you visit our website, our servers may automatically log the standard data
          provided by your web browser. It may include your device's Internet Protocol (IP) address, your browser
          type and version, the pages you visit, the time and date of your visit, the time spent on each page, other
          details about your visit, and technical details that occur in conjunction with any errors you may encounter.
          Please be aware that while this information may not be personally identifying by itself, it may be possible to
          combine it with other data to personally identify individual persons. We use a 3rd party analytics tool to monitor traffic on our site. </span></p>
      <span class="p-body-20">Personal Information</span></p>
      <p class="c1"><span class="team-text ">The game requests for information which may include one or more of the following:
          name, email, and basic demographic information. We only collect and use your personal information when we have a legitimate reason
          for doing so. The game is designed to expose you to the lives of people different from you, and hence it is relevant and useful for us to have a knowledge 
          of your demographic background. This demographic information is optional; you can choose not to provide any or all of it. We use this data for in-game analytics (eg to present anonymised information on how many players from different demographic groups have played, and share anonymised reflections as part of the in-game experience), 
          research (we have a Research Advisor who abides by a code of research ethics on the use of this data for social research on diversity and empathy in Singapore), and to help make the game more engaging for you. We will not associate any of your choices, 
          reflections, or data to you directly without your explicit permission. </span></p>

      <p class="c1"><span class="team-text ">We may collect personal information from you when you use a mobile device or web
          browser to access our content. This is to enable you to access and use our website, associated applications,
          and associated social media platforms. Some information that you actively submit during the reflections will be 
          presented to other users, but will not be associated with you personally. We may, for research or publicity reasons, extract quotes from those reflections
          without associating them to you (the quotes will be provided anonymously). Should we wish to associate them with you personally, we will seek your explicit permission.
