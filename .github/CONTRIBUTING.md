## Testing

Please keep unit testing in mind when contributing. Here is a great resource for this [Vue Test Utils](https://vue-test-utils.vuejs.org).
- Add tests for any new features
- If there is a bug create a test to see if it can be recreated and stop it from happening again.

 We understand unit testing can be a tough concept at the start of a coding career. We do not want this to be a barrier to stop you from contributing. Please add unit tests if you have the knowledge. If not please reach out to us in the PR and we will help you or point you at examples or documentation to help you implement them.

##  <a name="prProcess"></a> Pull Request Process

Before you submit your pull request consider the following guidelines:

* Search [GitHub](https://github.com/bettersg/saylah/pulls) for an open or closed Pull Request
  that relates to your submission. You don't want to duplicate effort.
* [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) this repo.
* [Clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) your copy.

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/saylah.git
    cd saylah/
    ```

* After cloning, set a new remote [upstream](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-remote-for-a-fork/) (this helps to keep your fork up to date)
    
    ```shell
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/bettersg/saylah.git
    ```

* Make your changes in a new git branch:

    ```shell
    git checkout -b my-fix-branch master
    ```

* Commit your changes using a descriptive commit message.

    ```shell
    git commit -a
    ```
  Note: the optional commit `-a` command line option will automatically "add" and "rm" edited files.

* Please add tests for new features you create. If not please state it in the PR. We can help you create them. But prefer for you to if you have the knowledge.

* Push your branch to GitHub:

    ```shell
    git push origin my-fix-branch
    ```

* In GitHub, send a pull request to `saylah:master`. This will run unit tests and lint tests using GitHub Actions, and if they do not pass we may request you for changes in the code.

If we suggest changes, then:

* Make the required updates.
* Re-run tests and make sure they still pass.
* Commit your changes to your branch (e.g. `my-fix-branch`).
* Push the changes to your GitHub repository (this will update your Pull Request).

If the PR gets too outdated we may ask you to rebase and force push to update the PR:

```shell
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/master
git push origin my-fix-branch -f
```

That's it! Thank you for your contribution!
