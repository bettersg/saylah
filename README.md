The application was originally created by [Merkie](https://github.com/Merkie), and you can find this application here: https://github.com/Merkie/freespeech.

Everything listed below is paraphrased from Merkie, the person with the original idea behind the tool!

## Why Was Freespeech Created?

Freespeech was created by Archer Calder in response to the few programs out there for non-verbal people that all cost upwards of $200 to $300. As a sibling of a non-verbal sister, he understood that these heavy costs can be big investments for families, especially ones that are not in the financial position to spend that kind of money. And he hopes Freespeech can get to the point where it can be a viable alternative to the other expensive apps out there. My goal is to help people communicate without a hefty cost.

Many people requested to donate to the project. He would first recommend you donate to the [Make A Wish](https://secure2.wish.org/site/SPageServer?pagename=donate_now&chid=100-000) charity as they gave his Sister, Della, a wish. If you feel inclined to donate to him and the development of this project, feel free to support him on [ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/merkie). He is trying to buy himself a new computer as he is currently developing off his parent's laptop. Any money left over after expenses will go to Make A Wish.

## What can run this program and what is its purpose?

This can currently only be ran in web browsers such as Google Chrome and Firefox however it will, in the future, be supported as an IOS and Android application. This program was created to help non-verbal people and allows the use of a series of buttons to produce sentences that allow them to communicate easily. It also provides a base that the users can modify to help them communicate with ease. 

## What is the plan for the future?

The program is always evolving and so the future development ideas can be found in the issues section under the issues [enhancement](https://github.com/bettersg/saylah/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aenhancement) tab.

## How do I use the program?

The web site for the program is up and useable, you can find it [here](http://saylah.sg/). All the changes merged with the `deploy` branch are available there.
